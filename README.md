# ReGen3D

A unified framework for 3D object generation and reconstruction using diffusion models. This project implements a novel approach combining generation and reconstruction tasks in a single framework.

## Overview

- Multi-category 3D object generation
- Shape reconstruction from partial observations
- Diffusion-based prior learning
- Unified representation learning

## Features

- Shape representation learning with geometric consistency
- Integrated diffusion priors for enhanced generation
- Multi-category object handling
- Efficient sampling and adaptation strategies

## Dataset Support

- ModelNet
- DTU SampleNet
- ShapeNet (pending access)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- CUDA-enabled GPU

## Paper
